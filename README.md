# RSA RoCC Accelerator

This is an accelerator that implements the RSA assymetric cryptography algorithm.
It is mainly meant to be used in the
[Chipyard development environment](https://github.com/ucb-bar/chipyard)
but can be ported to other environments (i.e. plain
[Rocket Chip](https://github.com/chipsalliance/rocket-chip)).

# Software Workloads

See [software/README.md](software/README.md) for more information on building software tests for this
accelerator.
